Every academic institution needs timetable for its functioning. Almost all college functions are computerized but timetable generation is still manually done in many institutes. Timetable scheduling is very complex problem involving many constraints. Scheduling timetable manually is time and effort consuming task. The problem is to manage the timetable such that it will satisfy all the constraints. The constraints include clashes of classrooms and timeslots, working hours of particular teacher or classrooms, number of lectures for particular subject, lunch breaks for class, etc.

We have implemented a semi-automated approach for solving this constraint heavy problem for institutions like COEP. It will allow users to make timetable  in a semi-automated manner while ensuring that all the constraints are satisfied.

{\bfseries Limitations of fully automated approach:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All constraints need to be ready at beginning.
\item All data input is mandatory at beginning. 
\item No flexibility.
\item Algorithm works mechanically, cant be modified.
\item Personalization not possible.
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Limitations of fully manual approach:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All constraints need to be checked manually.
\item Keeping track of data is very difficult.
\item Mechanical tasks need to be done manually.
\item Debugging timetable is really difficult.
\item Takes a lot of time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Statement}

To design and implement an application which can be used to manage the timetable of a department in an educational institute, ensuring that none of the constraints are violated and resources are used optimally while ensuring the flexibility of semi-automated approach.
